# AutomaticRecognitionOfPhysicalExercises
It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively using monitoring devices such as a *Fitbit*, *Nike Fuelband*, or *Jawbone Up*. These type of devices are part of the *quantified self* movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. There are opportunities here for Big Data scientists to develop new models to support QS data collection, integration, and analysis (Swan, 2013).   However, these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are usually not freely shared, and there is still some uncertainty about the best statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data. Furthermore, even if people regularly quantify **how much** of a particular activity they do, they rarely quantify **how well** they do it.   Velloso et al. (2013) investigated the automatic and robust qualitative recognition of execution mistakes, of "how well" an activity was performed by the wearer. That investigation potentially provides useful information for a large variety of applications, including digital assistants for physical exercises.  The goal of this project was to apply Machine Learning to the *Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset* to predict whether participants performed barbell lifts correctly or incorrectly.
